## 1. Case

While diving deeper in modern HTML & CSS, I required something to practice on. Why making something for the sake of practice only, while it can be also useful. Here it comes - CV, why not?

## 2. Tools

The aim was to make use of [Bootstrap 4](https://getbootstrap.com/ 'Bootstrap homepage') with as less additional rules as possible. Though, I couldn't bypass the fonts being set and very few style updates. Fonts, however, are not that important here, it can be changed as per personal preferences. I used - [Lora](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Lora 'Lora font page') and [Ubuntu](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Ubuntu 'Ubuntu font page') from [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/ 'Google Fonts homepage'), and [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/ 'Font Awesome homepage'). Lora is for text, Ubuntu is for header/navbar, Font Awesome - for icons.

Template is done fully in [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/ 'Visual Studio Code') (words Microsoft, nice, easy-to-use, clean and simple UI, mac, free - don't really stick together, but true) - well done Microsoft (comes from the Word 6.0 for DOS user).

## 3. Tweaks

As seen from _main.css_ file, only setting up the fonts, style and links. Last ones required for custom links decoration and Font Awesome ones.

## 4. Result

Ths result suppose to be professional looking document (looking literally as document), while having reflective design for nice looking mobile consumption. Added the link to PDF version of the CV (this has to be a prepared in advance PDF, saved to the `documents` folder.)

## 5. Use

For CV only you need the code, wrapped into the `<!-- CV part -->`. You can customize and use as you feel.
